Hi,

Iâ€™m a data engineer/scientist/analyst with up-to-date skills to help your organization to turn data into relevant and actionable insights, so you can make better decisions.

My experience in science and marketing, combined with up-to-date Data & AI skills ensure I can not only extract the value from complex data but  communicate that value as well.

I'm appreciated for my collaborative attitude, critical thinking ability and sense of humor, making me a valuable addition to a data team.
